	abstract = {Good performance of a company determines the position of the company in its market and the growth and consolidation of the market, giving as result the development of the economy as a whole. The importance of this topic further enhanced when dealing with insurance companies because: 1) insurance companies’ transfers risk in the economy 2) provide a mechanism to promote savings 3) promote investment activities. The growing importance of insurance companies in Albania and the importance of profitability as one of the key performance metrics of a company are the reasons why we decide to write this paper. The variation of profits between insurance companies over the years, within a country, leads to believe that internal factors play a major role in determining profitability. We have taken under study the impact of growth rate, liabilities, liquidity, fixed assets, volume of capital and company size on the profitability of insurance companies. The methodology used is based on quantitative methods and the data are provided by reliable sources such as annual reports of insurance companies’, FSA reports and NRC . We have taken under study 7 companies, including non-life and life insurance companies, from 2008- 2013. The results of the paper show that factors such as growth rate, liabilities, liquidity and fixed assets are the main factors affecting the profitability of insurers, where the growth rate is positively associated with profitability, while liabilities, liquidity and fixed assets are negatively correlated. Company size and the volume of capital are positively correlated with the profitability of insurance companies’, but their impact is statistically insignificant.},

So did the number of services and products they offer. At the same time even the competitive environment has changed, becoming more aggressive. In this way the problems and challenges for the insurance companies has been increased. The problems for the insurance companies have been increased even more after the global financial crisis as the financial crisis effects are felt either in Albania. For this reason I have decided to treat in this paper the insurance companies, the problems and challenges facing this market. At the beginning of this paper I will present the current situation in the insurance companies market. I will show the progress of this market in years. Also I will show how the current economic indicators of this market are. Further I will make a presentation of the problems and challenges that are facing this potential market. It will also try to draw some conclusions and give some recommendations. In this paper are used more narrative and analytical methods.

	abstract = {In the last few decades, the international insurance industry has been confronted with a drastic increase in the scope and frequency of great natural disasters. The trend is primarily attributable to the continuing steady growth of the world population and the increasing concentration of people and economic values in urban areas. An additional factor is the global migration of populations and industries into areas such as coastal regions, which are particularly exposed to natural hazards. The natural hazards themselves, on the other hand, have not yet shown any significant increase. In addition to the problems the insurance industry has with regard to pricing, capacity and loss reserves, the assessment of insured liabilities, preventive planning and the proper adjustment of catastrophe losses are gaining importance. The present problems will be dramatically aggravated if the greenhouse predictions come true. The increased intensity of all convective processes in the atmosphere will force up the frequency and severity of tropical cyclones, tornados, hailstorms, floods and storm surges in many parts of the world with serious consequences for all types of property insurance. Rates will have to be raised and in certain coastal areas insurance cover will only be available after considerable restrictions have been imposed, as for example significant deductibles and low liability or loss limits. In areas of high insurance density the loss potential of individual catastrophes can reach a level at which the national and international insurance industries will run into serious capacity problems. Recent disasters showed the disproportionately high participation of reinsurers in extreme disaster losses and the need for more risk transparency if the insurance industry is to fulfil its obligations in an increasingly hostile environment.},

The right to health care is a fundamental right of a social – economic character and aims respect of human rights, equality and social justice.

This article, using data for 225 cities, examines the determinants of China’s insurance development, measured by premium volume, insurance density, and insurance penetration.

Per capita GDP is the only variable significant for all measures of life consumption, while the total population, savings deposit, education attainment, telephone ownership per capita, social welfare expenditure, and young dependency are significant for life premiums. Variables such as wage level, savings deposit, and investment in fixed assets, report their significant effect on the demand for property insurance.

Two independent reviewers extracted the data from eligible articles and input into a standardized form. Based on the inclusion criteria, 35 articles were included in this systematic review. Most of the studies were quantitative researches with topics such as the development level of commercial health insurance in China, the demand and supply issues related, and the relationship and influence of social health insurance, as well as the moral issues evolved from commercial health insurance system. In summary, CHI in China is still at the early development stage. Among those few evidence-based articles, the findings suggested several policy implication and different market strategy.

Model parameters in non-Western countries differ systematically from those in Western countries, with poorer countries substantially more risk tolerant than rich countries on average. We qualify previous findings on gender effects and cognitive ability by showing how they mainly impact likelihood-dependence. We further add novel evidence on the correlation between risk preferences and study major. Whereas we confirm previous results on observable characteristics of subjects explaining little of overall preference heterogeneity, a few macroeconomic indicators can explain a considerable part of the between-country heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {By proposing the Benchmark Ratio of Insurance Penetration (BRIP) as a new paradigm for international insurance comparison, this paper makes a new assessment and comparison of insurance growth levels of certain countries as well as certain economic groups, and further discusses the policy implications. The main conclusions of this paper are as follows. First, it is necessary to have a new recognition of the international insurance growth pattern: the relative level of insurance growth in developed markets has declined as compared with that indicated by traditional indicators, and the relative level of insurance growth in developing markets has increased. The relative growth level of the insurance industry in developed markets is still higher than that in developing markets, but the insurance industry in emerging markets and Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) is undergoing rapid development and has achieved a relatively high level. Second, when considering global expansion strategy, insurance companies should not only continue to consolidate market share in developed markets but also actively explore developing markets. In the meantime, insurance companies need to pay special attention to the fact that the relative insurance growth of emerging markets and BRIC has already reached a relatively high level. Although there is still significant potential for growth, the growth will mainly be driven by the ordinary economic factors, and the pattern of insurance growth would be expected to experience great changes. Third, the insurance industry policy for developing countries should focus on the adjustment and improvement of the pattern of growth instead of the quantitative increase in growth, so as to build a solid foundation for sustainable insurance growth in the long-term future. Fourth, the traditional paradigms are confined by certain limitations, so that we have to establish a more solid paradigm for international insurance comparison. By doing so, we can build a more reasonable foundation for international cooperation in insurance regulation and for relevant negotiation of international trade.},

Our system GMM estimator’s analysis reveals that cultural factors, public health spending, economic freedom, financial development, human development, life expectancy, dependency ratio, and the Muslim religion are the major determinants of life insurance consumption at the aggregate level (i.e., for all sample economies). Between the group of advanced economies and the group of emerging and developing economies, these results, however, differ dramatically. It is noteworthy that cultural factors, such as masculinity and uncertainty avoidance, do not account for life insurance spending in advanced economies but have a statistically significant impact on life insurance consumption in emerging and developing economies. One point of interest is that our findings demonstrate that consumers in advanced nations as well as emerging and developing economies with a higher degree of public health spending and economic freedom tend to spend more on life insurance products. Both international life insurance businesses and governments from all around the world can benefit from the findings.},

The results differ between risk-preference measurements and also men and women. We use March 13, 2020, when President Trump declared a national state of emergency as a time anchor to define the pre-pandemic and on-pandemic periods. The pre-pandemic experiment was conducted on February 21, 2020. There are three on-pandemic rounds conducted 10 days, 15 days, and 20 days after the COVID-19 emergency declaration. We include four different risk-preference measures. Men are more sensitive to the pandemic and become more risk-averse based on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Women become more risk-averse in the Social and Experience Seeking domains based on the results from the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) and Sensation Seeking Scales (SSS). Both men's and women's risk-preference are stable during COVID-19 based on a Gamble Choice (GC) task. The results match our hypotheses which are based on the discussion about whether the psychological construct of risk-preference is general or domain-specific. The differential outcomes between incentivized behavioral and self-reported propensity measures of risk-preference in our experiment show the caveats for studies using a single measure to test risk-preference changes during COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Subjects decide how many boxes to collect out of 100, one of which contains a bomb. Earnings increase linearly with the number of boxes accumulated but are zero if the bomb is also collected. The BRET requires minimal numeracy skills, avoids truncation of the data, allows the precise estimation of both risk aversion and risk seeking, and is not affected by the degree of loss aversion or by violations of the Reduction Axiom. We validate the BRET, test its robustness in a large-scale experiment, and compare it to three popular risk elicitation tasks. Choices react significantly only to increased stakes, and are sensible to wealth effects. Our experiment rationalizes the gender gap that often characterizes choices under uncertainty by means of a higher loss rather than risk aversion.},

In one, subjects were paid a fixed sum for completing the survey and that sum was then at risk in the subsequent gamble choices. In the other, all payoff amounts for the gambles were nonnegative. Subjects were paid according to their choices and the outcomes of the gambles. We tested for sex differences in this choice task and found women to be consistently more risk averse, on average, than men. We observed no difference across frames. Subjects were then asked to guess the gamble choices of each of the other participants and were rewarded for each correct answer. Subjects of both sexes did substantially better than chance in guessing the particular choices of individuals of both sexes, but both men and women overestimated the risk aversion of others, especially that of women, and most strongly of all with respect to men's predictions of women's choices.

	abstract = {Risk perception is often studied without further specifying to whom the risk is supposed to pertain—the risk target. Such specification is important, in particular as to whether the risk pertains to the respondents themselves (personal risk) or to other people (general risk). In the present study, participants judged the personal and general risk of a large number of hazards. Average personal risk was judged as smaller than general risk, often much smaller, and the two sets of risk judgments did not have the same rank order. Furthermore, they had different correlates. Gender differences in perceived risk were found to be much more pronounced for general than for personal risk. For personal risk, gender differences were most pronounced for hazards where there was a small perceived capacity of protection, while gender differences tended to be more constant for general risk. Economic vulnerability had an effect on both personal and general risk, but a stronger effect on general risk. Similar effects of economic vulnerability were found for men and women, refuting the parallel with a ‘white male effect’. Demand for risk mitigation in most cases was more strongly related to general than to personal risk, but the present results also showed this trend to be weakened or even reversed in cases where personal risk was perceived to be at the same level as general risk; hazards where this was the case included nuclear technology and depletion of the ozone layer. In a second study it was found that nonspecific risk ratings (no risk target specified) were most closely related to general rather than personal risk, and that one's own responsibility for risk management was regarded as much lower than governmental responsibility. Implications for risk communication are discussed.},

These methods are compared in a manner that will help the practitioner decide which one to use, and how to deal with methodological issues associated with incentives, stakes, and the structure of choice menus. Applications involve using inferred risk preferences to document demographic effects, e.g. gender, and to explain the effects of risk aversion on observed behavior in economic in settings, e.g. bargaining, auctions, and contests.

Results are confirmed by structural estimations, which also support a constant relative risk aversion representation of preferences. Gender differences correlate with the presence of a safe option and fixed probabilities in the elicitation method.

	abstract = {Epidemiological data indicate that risk behaviors are among the leading causes of adolescent morbidity and mortality worldwide. Consistent with this, laboratory-based studies of age differences in risk behavior allude to a peak in adolescence, suggesting that adolescents demonstrate a heightened propensity, or inherent inclination, to take risks. Unlike epidemiological reports, studies of risk taking propensity have been limited to Western samples, leaving questions about the extent to which heightened risk taking propensity is an inherent or culturally constructed aspect of adolescence. In the present study, age patterns in risk-taking propensity (using two laboratory tasks: the Stoplight and the BART) and real-world risk taking (using self-reports of health and antisocial risk taking) were examined in a sample of 5,227 individuals (50.7\% female) ages 10–30 (M = 17.05 years, SD = 5.91) from 11 Western and non-Western countries (China, Colombia, Cyprus, India, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the US). Two hypotheses were tested: (1) risk taking follows an inverted-U pattern across age groups, peaking earlier on measures of risk taking propensity than on measures of real-world risk taking, and (2) age patterns in risk taking propensity are more consistent across countries than age patterns in real-world risk taking. Overall, risk taking followed the hypothesized inverted-U pattern across age groups, with health risk taking evincing the latest peak. Age patterns in risk taking propensity were more consistent across countries than age patterns in real-world risk taking. Results suggest that although the association between age and risk taking is sensitive to measurement and culture, around the world, risk taking is generally highest among late adolescents.},

Using a sample of 48 countries from 1998 to 2019 (a total of 111,697 firm-year observations), we document a positive relationship between Individualism and corporate risk-taking. This result is robust to potential endogeneity concerns, alternative default horizons, an alternative measure for corporate risk-taking, and alternative measures of Individualism.},
